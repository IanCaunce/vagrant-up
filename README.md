## Vagrant-Up!

If, like me, you only *ever* want a single vagrant instance running, use this!

After installation, run `vagrant-up` and all running
vagrant machines will be suspended before it brings up
only the current vagrant machine. You can pass existing vagrant arguments such as `vagrant-up --provision`.

## Installation

### Via Composer

    $ composer global require gpmcadam/vagrant-up
